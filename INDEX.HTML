	<h2> Affordable Housing </h2>
		<p>The Congresswoman has said that housing is a <a href="https://clarke.house.gov/clarke-co-leads-h-r-4791-the-protecting-renters-from-evictions-act-of-2021-and-supports-reconvening-to-vote-on-extending-the-national-eviction-moratorium/">"human right"</a>. In 2021 she co-led  <em>H.R.4791, The Protecting Renters From Evictions Act of 2021</em>, which would extend the national eviction moratorium through at least December 31, 2021 in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. In 2022, Congresswoman Clarke introduced the <em>Affordable Housing and Area Median Income Fairness Act</em>- a bicameral legislation act with New York Senator Kristen Gillibrand which would address the challenges faced when trying to access afforable housing. The bill would invest $15 billion dollars into affordable housing every year for the next 10 years. Congresswoman Clarke <a href="https://www.gillibrand.senate.gov/news/press/release/amidst-housing-crisis-gillibrand-clarke-announce-reintroduction-of-housing-bill-to-invest-15-billion-annually-in-affordable-housing/#:~:text=“The%20Affordable%20Housing%20and%20Area,class%20families%20in%20New%20York.">said,</a>"Soaring rent prices and a severe shortage of affordable housing units are displacing low-income communities nationwide, including my hometown of Brooklyn. This makes basic housing unattainable for those who need it most." </p>


	<h2> Education </h2>
		<p>Congresswoman Yvette D. Clarke is a strong advocate for educational equity, with a focus in making education more accessible and afordable for Black, Brown and underserved communities. Since the beginning of her tenure in Congress in 2013, Congresswoman Clarke has strongly <a href="https://clarke.house.gov/congresswoman-clarke-opposes-high-interest-rates-on-student-loans/">opposed high interest rates</a> on student loans, at the time saying she couldn't, "support a bill that we know will limit access to higher education by increasing the cost of college for students and their families." She has carried this stance throughout her time in Congress, most recently supporting Presidnet Biden's Student Debt Relief Plan. </p>


	<h2> Immigration </h2>
		<p>In 2009, Congresswoman Clarke voted in favor of the DREAM Act, legislation that would permanently protect certain immigrants who came to the United States as children who face the risk of deportation. Since then she has <a href="https://clarke.house.gov/clarke-co-leads-american-dream-promise-act-of-2023/">co-sponsored </a>various cersion of the DREAM Act including the <em>American Dream and Promise Act</em> of 2021 and 2023. She has pushed for a direct path to citizenship for individuals with Temporary Protected Status (TPS) and Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) recipients.</p>


		<p>Most recently, Congresswoman Clarke along with the Co-Chairs of the Haitian Caucus <a href="https://clarke.house.gov/clarke-and-haiti-caucus-co-chairs-stand-in-solidarity-with-haitian-community-and-introduce-resolution-condemning-anti-haitian-attacks/">introduced resolution </a>condemning attacks on Haitian communities following remarks made by former President Donald Trump during the presidential debate. She said, "I am proud to stand alongside my colleagues and our many like-minded allies to reject the hatred of powerful politicians, billionaires, and extreme activists. Make no mistake – we will always rise to protect the rights of immigrants to this nation to find their own American Dream.”"

	<h2> Abortion </h2>
		<p>Congresswoman Clarke describes herself as "pro-choice". Following the Supreme Court's decision to overturn Roe v. Wade in 2022, the congresswoman <a href="https://clarke.house.gov/congresswoman-clarke-issues-statement-on-supreme-court-decision-overturning-roe-v-wade/">issued a statement </a>calling the day "the darkest in our nation's history". While she has praised the state of New York for continuing to protect the "right to choose" she actively supports efforts to reinstate the the Dobbs decision to protect women's reproductive health across the country. </p>
